Essa semana eu terminei de reler o 5º livro da série "Song of Ice and Fire", que deu origem à série Game of Thrones, da HBO.

E não conseguia me livrar das relações entre as situações vividas pelos diversos personagens e aquelas por que passam os concurseiros, todos os dias. Então resolvi tirar lições de Game of Thrones para todos os concurseiros.

Atenção: pode conter _spoliers_!

## Todo lord precisa de um bom Maester
![](/images/GoT/livro_maester_chain.png)
1. Find your Maester Accountant. Your business needs one.

“Service as a Maester is a noble calling, one of vital importance to a prosperous realm. It is little wonder there are some who refer to the Order as the Knights of the Mind.”
―Maester Luwin

So who are these Maesters? Every House in Game of Thrones has a Maester who is crucial to the proper running of the castle and the respective family. They handle various tasks for the family they serve, from being a doctor to bookkeeping. They do a good job, with total dedication. There is an episode when Brandon of House Stark falls from a tower and is paralyzed. Everyone is busy tending to his needs. Even in that situation, Maester Luwin urges Catelyn (Bran’s mother) to look at the books to see how much they have spent on the royal visit.

The traditional LMS keeps knowledge locked away in the center accessible only on desktop, like a Maester in a castle. We have the consequences where knowledge and insights fails to reach those in need. With unprecedented levels of smartphone penetration amongst your learners, you have the ability to unlock knowledge and deliver learning to the fingertips of your employees everyday.

ike Arya Stark’s Needle and Oberyn Martell’s spear, a light and agile weapon is often more suitable than heavy duty armor. In Tyrion’s ‘trial by combat’ at the Vale, the sellsword Bronn successfully wears down a heavily armored Ser Vardis Egen using agility and skill to win.

3. Daenerys has her dragons. What’s your flagship?

Daenerys is the only daughter and youngest child of King Aerys Targaryen (the Mad King). She was displaced from her home when the Mad King was killed and is now gathering up an army to recapture the throne, to which she is an apparent heir. The Khaleesi has a small army of Dothraki warriors and an army of 8,600 unsullied soldiers. But it is her three dragons on whom she is dependent to reclaim the Iron Throne, just like her forefathers. The dragons scare even the mighty Tywin Lannister.

The subtle lesson here is that no matter how many products your business sells, you should always have a flagship product with which you can churn money faster than the others. Be it a product or service, there should always be a cash cow for your business. Hence, if you have a product that does better than the others, ensure the run never ends. Investing more in your flagship will definitely pay off.


## Tomar decisões com base nas emoções não é bom pra cabeça

5. The best kings rule with their heads and not their hearts. Business is not that different!

Oberyn Martell, or ‘The Red Viper’ was undoubtedly one of the most charming characters of all the four seasons combined, and his death scene left us mind blown too, although not quite the same way. But there is something we can learn from the way Oberyn met his end. Oberyn takes on the Mountain, Gregor Clegane, to whom he is a mismatch in size and power. However, he puts on a show greater than the sum of his parts, partly fueled  by the idea of vengeance. He brings down the Mountain but refrains from delivering the final blow, desperate to see him confess his crime first. The one moment of carelessness when he betrays his emotions, provides the Mountain the opening he wanted.

Just as the Viper is in complete control as long as he is impassive, be ruthless and aggressive when it comes to managing your finances and pursuing the payments you are owed. One careless ‘heart over head’ moment could prove to be the tipping point, one late payment you tolerate may be the start of more. Prioritize your customers based on the right business reasons and nothing more. ‘No sentiment in business’ is the mantra we’re preaching, especially when it comes to setting due dates and making sure you get paid on time. Ensure the business decisions you take are based purely on the actual cards on the table.

7. Never underestimate yourself


Jon Snow proved it, you can go from being the black sheep of the Stark family to becoming Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, just by trusting your instincts.



Words carry more power than weapons. Game of Thrones likely enjoys a wider mass appeal than most fantasy since it spends more time exploring political intrigue and human sociology than it does swords and sorcery. Many of the fictional world’s conflicts are fought in council chambers, at dinner tables, and in gardens, not on battlefields. Lies and manipulations are the weapons of choice. In fact, many of the physically weakest characters, who don’t carry positions of authority, often wield much more influence and power than is first apparent.

Lord Varys (The Spider), Lord Baelish (Littlefinger), and Tyrion Lannister (The Imp), are all perfect examples of this type of smart, manipulative character and savvy politician. They use well-placed words and subtle suggestions to manipulate events to their liking, rather than armies or direct power. Often, their victims don’t even realize they are targets of attack, until it’s too late. When you see a sword being swung at you, it’s obvious to defend with your shield and counter attack, but how do you defend against malicious whispers and rumors that you may not even hear yourself?

In the security industry, we call this sort of threat actor a social engineer. Social engineers prey on weaknesses in human behavior to trick unsuspecting users into doing things they shouldn’t, rather than exploiting technological flaws to break into networks.

Unfortunately, our industry spends more time defending against technological threats than human ones. Social engineering attacks don’t rely on technical flaws, so the best mechanical defenses do little to stop them. While you should certainly bolster your technical defenses, don’t forget to spend time educating your users to make them aware of the tricks social engineers exploit. You may have erected a castle wall, but that won’t prevent an attacker from tricking an untrained guard into opening your gates.

## Cuidado com os inimigos internos

4. Beware the insider threat. While you’re considering the manipulative characters in Game of Thrones, don’t forget that these characters often attack people in their own group. If, say, the Lannisters used every shady, backhanded, manipulative trick in their book to defeat an obviously evil enemy, such as the White Walkers, you’d probably forgive them. However, the manipulators in GOT target members of their own kingdom, council, and even family, for personal gain. In other words, they are insiders carrying out insider attacks.

Spoiler alert: Avoid the next paragraph if you haven’t watched the latest TV episodes.

Perceptive viewers just saw a perfect example of an insider attack during the latest TV episode (S4EP2), when King Joffery dies under mysterious circumstances (hurrah!). If you’ve read the books, or noticed some of the subtle visual cues in the episode, you may have already guessed the culprit. But even if you have no clue whodunit, you probably still suspect poison, and realize that Joffrey’s attacker must have been close. One second he was drinking a cup of wine without issue, the next second a sip of wine resulted in swift death; a classic insider job.

The take-away here is obvious, but still quite important. Inside attackers are not fiction. Malicious insiders have carried out many real-world security breaches and data leaks. It’s easy to overlook the insider threat, since malicious insiders are harder to identify and do anything about (they already have elevated access), but you need to remain wary of the threat.

Some basic defensive advice includes vetting your employees and partners carefully, implementing internal segmentation and access control to enforce least privilege principles, and leveraging data loss prevention technology to identify leaks, even when they come from within.

## Sem treino não há guerreiro

5. The best training makes the best defenders. One of the things I like most about A Game of Thrones is its strong female characters. Unlike in stereotypical, outdated fantasy troupes, most women in this story aren’t princesses in need of saving. One of my favorite female characters is Arya Stark. When we first meet Arya, she’s a small, nine-year-old girl. Initially, most would not suspect her to be a character of much consequence in an epic tale about battles with medieval knights, wicked sorcerers, mystical zombies, and dragons. Yet, Ayra develops into one fierce warrior.

What makes the difference? Well, Arya’s heart and attitude have much to do with it, but ultimately, I would argue training is what makes her the accomplished fighter she becomes. Arya hones her skills every chance she gets. Early in the series, the girl strives to receive bow training that the menfolk typically reserve for boys. In King’s Landing, she trains in a graceful style of swordplay called Water Dancing, chasing cats to improve her balance. Finally, for those who read the books, she joins the guild of Faceless Men, where she receives even more specialized training from the Kindly Man. Through this training Arya becomes a formidable character, and as a result, I’m sure we’ll see great things from her.

Like the best warriors out there, the best network defenders are those who train the most. The more you immerse yourself in information security knowledge, news, and practices, the better you’ll be at defending your organization. While every pundit has a different view of the various certifications out there, all of them require some study, which means you are training in your field. If you are passionate about protecting your network, continue to learn all you can about infosec. Play with attacker tools (many are freely available in Kali linux), not just security controls. Read the latest research from the smartest whitehat hackers. Simply put, the more you train in your field, the better you’ll get at it.

## O Inverno está chegando

6. Winter is coming (or stay vigilant). Even if you’ve not caught a single episode of Game of Thrones, or cracked any of the books, if you follow Internet pop culture you’ve probably seen references to the phrase “Winter is coming.”

“Winter is coming” is the motto of House Stark, one of the main GOT protagonist families. As a family of the North, the Starks’ forefathers were directly affected and closely involved in “The Long Night,” which was the first time the White Walkers invaded the lands of Westeros. As a result, the Starks better remember the atrocities and sufferings of that time, whereas other citizens dismiss it all as legend. The motto “Winter is coming” is the Starks’ way of reminding their descendants to stay vigilant against future strife and attacks.

The advice to “stay vigilant” directly applies to information security. In fact, if I could only give one piece of security advice, it would be to stay vigilant. The techniques blackhat hackers exploit to breach our networks will continue to change, our defenses depreciate over time and need updating, but one thing remains constant. There is a threat actor somewhere on the Internet who wants your digital information. Constant vigilance means you accept that the threat is real, and remain continually cognizant of potential new attacks. Even if you don’t have the latest, high-tech security gadget or largest team of crack security experts, your vigilance will allow you to recognize and react to real digital attacks much quicker than the apathetic administrators who ignore the threat entirely.
