We all begin our CFA studies with the best intentions, forming good habits such as eating well, sleeping enough, reducing stress levels... generally striking a sensible balance between all the different priorities in your life currently. We do this in hope to maximise our focus and productivity for every precious minute we pour into learning the materials.

However, as tiredness catches up with you in the next few months, it gets tougher to maintain such discipline and you may find that your attention span starts to dwindle faster.

While coffee can be an effective tool when used correctly, it's not a long term solution. Luckily for us, there's another often overlooked, but scientifically proven tool that can help boost your study focus and creativity - ambient sounds.
How does ambient noises affect our creative thinking?
A 2012 research published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that moderate level of ambient sounds boost creativity for most people. Compared to a relatively quiet environment (50 decibels, similar to an office environment or a quiet suburb), a moderate level of ambient noise (70 decibels) proved to be optimal, as a high level of noise (85 decibels, e.g. sound of a food blender) starts to be annoying and distracting.

Modest amount of background noise creates enough of a distraction to encourage people to think more broadly and think outside the box. However, for tasks that require close attention to detail (like proofreading or doing your taxes) would be better performed in quieter environments. As for studying for the CFA, most of the material require understanding and some thought, rather than mundane concepts that are purely memorised - therefore there are benefits to incorporating the right kind of music for your studies (do check out the 300 Hours study music collection too!).

Luckily for you, there are a huge variety of (mostly) free apps and tools on the Internet that you can test and incorporate in your study routine, depending on your preferences:


Sounds of coffee shops and cafes

WHY IS BROWN NOISE GOOD FOR YOU?

Your working or studying surroundings can have a strong influence on how you feel and hence on how you perform. The wrong sound environment can affect and lower your motivation, your productivity and it can keep distracting you. Brown Noise is a noise which contains all the frequencies that are audible to humans, boosting the lower frequency range. It is very good to block out annoying noises and to enhance sound privacy. With Noisli you can create a pleasant noise environment and easily mask annoying noises in order to better focus and boost your concentration.

How it works: If music is too distracting for your tastes, but your chatty co-workers, office machinery, and general clamor are even more distracting, colored noise might be a worthy addition to your audio repertoire.

Noise generators, usually grouped into groups of white, pink, or brown/red, cover a range of your ear's audible spectrum with generic sound to mask or lessen the distractions of other sounds. Wikipedia's entry on sound masking puts it best:
